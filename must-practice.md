Perfect, Ahnaf! You're thinking like a real problem solver now. 🧠🔥  
Let’s break this into two parts:

## ✅ Part 1: **5 Most Important + Popular Frequency Array Problems**

These are handpicked to give you **complete understanding** — from counting basics to applying frequency logic in clever ways.

---

### 🔥 1. **Check if Two Strings are Anagrams**

**Problem**:  
Given two lowercase strings, check if they are anagrams.

**Why Important**:  
Introduces using a frequency array for characters.

**Logic**:
- Use `int freq[26] = {0}`
- Do `freq[s1[i] - 'a']++` and `freq[s2[i] - 'a']--`
- If all values in `freq` are 0 → they are anagrams

---

### 🔥 2. **Find the Most Frequent Element**

**Problem**:  
Given an array of integers (0–9), find the element that appears the most.

**Why Important**:  
Teaches counting + max frequency detection.

**Logic**:
- Count frequency
- Track max value and corresponding element

---

### 🔥 3. **Can You Make a Palindrome?**

**Problem**:  
Check if characters of a string can be rearranged to make a palindrome.

**Why Important**:  
Teaches how frequency properties apply to logic.

**Logic**:
- Count character frequency
- At most one character can have an odd frequency

---

### 🔥 4. **Count Good Pairs**

**Problem**:  
Given an array, count pairs `(i, j)` where `arr[i] == arr[j]` and `i < j`.

**Why Important**:  
Uses math with frequency: `f * (f - 1) / 2` for each value

---

### 🔥 5. **Check if String Has All Unique Characters**

**Problem**:  
Given a string, check if all characters are unique.

**Why Important**:  
Great for learning how to catch duplicates using frequency.

**Logic**:
- If `freq[ch - 'a'] > 1` at any point → not unique

## 📝 Part 2: **5 Practice Problems for You**

Here are 5 beginner-friendly problems to **practice and master** frequency arrays. I’ve added input/output expectations too.

---

### 🧪 Problem 1: Count Digit Frequencies
**Input**: A single number (e.g., `1223441`)  
**Output**:
```
0: 0
1: 2
2: 2
3: 1
4: 2
5-9: 0
```

💡 *Hint*: Use `n % 10` and `n / 10`

---

### 🧪 Problem 2: Count Distinct Elements
**Input**: `arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5}`  
**Output**: `5` (since 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

💡 *Hint*: Count how many `freq[i] > 0`

---

### 🧪 Problem 3: Most Frequent Character in a String
**Input**: `"programming"`  
**Output**: `'g' → 2` (or whichever is the highest)

💡 *Hint*: Use `int freq[26]` for 'a'-'z'

---

### 🧪 Problem 4: Are Strings Anagrams?
**Input**: `"listen"`, `"silent"`  
**Output**: `YES`

💡 *Hint*: Count and compare frequencies

---

### 🧪 Problem 5: Count Total Pairs With Equal Values
**Input**: `arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 2, 1}`  
**Output**: `4`  
Pairs: (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (2,2)

💡 *Hint*: Use formula `f * (f - 1) / 2` for each value with freq ≥ 2
